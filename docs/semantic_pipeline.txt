Semantic Mapping Pipeline
---------------------------------------------

1. Import Mesh

1a. Think about how to store and retrieve the data (Dejan), e.g. 
when user inspects the registerted model it shall have a side image widget for introspection.

2. Is Model complete?       (Dejan)
    -Allow the user to 'complete' the model by finishing planes, edges, fine details with a GUI.
    -Includes 'inside' data.  Inside of drawers, doors etc.
    -complete areas where there were problems with specular surfaces

3. Principle axis identification/alignment.
 3.1 Is the alignmnet to walls/ceiling correct?
     Allow user input of 90 degree rotations
     
4. Segmentation of Planes
    - use connected components from alex trevor (see paper/pcl)

 4.1 Check if correct
     -Allow user to select correct planes
     -Allow user to select incorrect planes
     -Deal with over/under segmentation (merge/split)
     -rerun algorithm (refined parameters/thresholds)
     -specify a plane by selecting points
     
5. Segment Fixtures

 5.1 Check if correct
     -Allow user to select correct fixtures
     -Allow user to select incorrect fixture
     -rerun algorithm (refined parameters/thresholds)
     -specify a fixture by selecting points
     -specify hidden handles (e.g. recessed handles for dishwashers)

6. User Interaction - obtain data for articulation model
    -User is asked to move kinect to drawer and setup with tripod
    -Run segmentation (returns if successful or not)
    -Ask user to open the door.  (Specify openning angle as parameter)
    -Record video pointcloud
    
7. Segment doors/drawers/moving parts 
    -Difference segmentation
    -Articulation Model (juergen)
    
  7.1 Check if correct
    -rerun algorithm
    
8. Labelling 
   -group and label planes
   -use ray tracing to find planes that belong to a container
   -certain fixtures must also be grouped, e.g. handles
   -user interface to label items -drop down menu containing options
   -User can also manually enter a name 

 8.1 Check if correct
   -Grouping of segmented planes/fixtures could end up not being classified correctly
   -User can select which segmented items belong to which container
   
9. Export to KnowRob
 
 
Sidenotes
--------------

-Interaction of running algorithms (steps described above) is provided by the GUI (dejan)
-GUI can select mesh or point cloud for visualization
-Conversion between mesh/pointcloud required
-All segmented data is to be saved in a database.  Each item shall be labeled by its segmentation step (among other things)
